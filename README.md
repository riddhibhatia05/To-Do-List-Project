Project Name: To-Do-List-Project

Project Objective: The objective of this program is to provide users with a flexible and feature-rich to-do list management system that can be operated via a command-line interface. The program allows users to manage their tasks efficiently by providing functionalities such as adding tasks with priorities and due dates, deleting tasks, marking tasks as completed, prioritizing tasks, searching for tasks containing specific keywords, and saving tasks to a file for persistence between program runs.

Key Features: Key features of this program include:
1. Task Management: Users can add tasks with optional priorities and due dates, delete tasks, mark tasks as completed, and prioritize tasks.
2. Search Functionality: Users can search for tasks containing specific keywords to quickly find relevant tasks.
3. Persistence: The program saves tasks to a file, allowing them to persist between program runs. This ensures that users' task lists are not lost when the program is closed and reopened.
4. Flexibility: Users have the flexibility to customize their tasks with priorities and due dates, enabling better organization and time management.
5. User-Friendly Interface: The command-line interface provides a straightforward and intuitive way for users to interact with the to-do list application, making it easy to use and understand.
6. Efficient Task Prioritization: Users can prioritize tasks based on their importance, helping them focus on completing high-priority tasks first.
7. Convenience: The program offers a comprehensive set of features for managing tasks, reducing the need for users to use multiple tools or applications for task management.
--> Overall, the objective is to provide users with a robust and efficient tool for managing their tasks effectively, with features designed to enhance productivity and organization.

Advanced Features: In the advanced version of the to-do list application, several features have been implemented to enhance functionality and user experience:
1. Task Prioritization: Users can assign priorities to tasks, allowing them to differentiate between tasks based on their importance or urgency. This feature enables users to focus on completing high-priority tasks first.
2. Due Dates: Users can set due dates for tasks, providing a way to track deadlines and manage time effectively. Due dates are displayed alongside tasks, helping users prioritize and plan their work accordingly.
3. Search Functionality: Users can search for tasks containing specific keywords, making it easier to find relevant tasks quickly. This feature enhances efficiency by allowing users to filter and locate tasks based on their descriptions or contents.
4. Persistence: Tasks are saved to a file, ensuring that they persist between program runs. This feature enables users to retain their task lists across sessions, eliminating the need to re-enter tasks each time the program is restarted.
5. File I/O: The program utilizes file input/output (I/O) operations to save and load tasks from a JSON file. This enables seamless data storage and retrieval, enhancing the reliability and robustness of the application.
6. Comprehensive Task Details: Task objects contain additional information such as priority, due date, and completion status. This allows users to track and manage tasks more effectively, providing a comprehensive overview of task-related details.
7. User Interaction: The program features an interactive command-line interface, allowing users to input commands and interact with the application seamlessly. User-friendly prompts guide users through various operations, enhancing usability and accessibility.
--> Overall, these advanced features enhance the functionality, flexibility, and usability of the to-do list application, providing users with a comprehensive tool for managing tasks efficiently.

To test the functionality:
1. Run the code.
2. Add tasks using the entry field and "Add Task" button.
3. Mark tasks as completed by selecting them and clicking the "Mark as Completed" button.
4. Delete tasks by selecting them and clicking the "Delete Task" button.
5. Close the application and run it again to see that the tasks are still present.
